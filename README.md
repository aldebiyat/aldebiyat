The short version
I'm a backend-heavy full-stack engineer who obsesses over performance, data architecture, and building things that actually work at scale. I've shipped platforms used across 170+ countries, optimized queries by 40%, and led teams through complex migrations without breaking production.

What I actually do
AreaWhat that means in practiceBackend ArchitectureDesign APIs and services that handle real traffic without falling over. Golang, Node.js, NestJS, GraphQL, gRPC.Data & PerformanceQuery optimization, indexing strategies, caching layers. I've cut response times by 40% on production systems.Search & AnalyticsBuilt embedded analytics platforms from scratch. Elasticsearch, Typesense, data pipelines.Cloud InfrastructureDocker, Kubernetes, AWS. I deploy things that stay deployed.Team LeadershipCode reviews, mentorship, architectural decisions. I make teams faster, not just codebases.

How I think about engineering
1. Make it work
2. Make it right
3. Make it fast
4. Make it maintainable by someone who isn't you
I care about code that survives contact with real users, real traffic, and real deadlines. I'd rather ship something solid than something clever.
